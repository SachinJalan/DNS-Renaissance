This folder consits of scripts used to gneerate the Mini-NDN results.  

In the `tests` directory, there is a simple network in which the prelimenary idea was implemented. Then it was finally implemented in `ndn-dns-geant.py`.  
It uses Mini-NDN and many of it's tools such as the ndn traffic generator.
